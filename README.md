## Overview
This is a stock data App from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co). I use two kinds of stock data which is intraday stock and time series daily adjusted.

## Feature
* Search Intraday data of a stock symbols and sort it based on open, high, low, and date value.
* Input multiple time series daily adjusted symbols at a time and compare it together (Maximum 3 symbols compared).
* Set and save your own API Key into KeyChain and other configure data parameter (interval and output size).

## Technology & Style Used
